### 5.3_stage.py

**Functionality**  
This script divides the full time series into predefined stages and calculates descriptive statistics for each stage.  
It computes metrics such as mean, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), and confidence intervals.  
The results are summarized in both tabular and graphical formats, allowing comparison of variability across stages.

**Input data**  
- Excel file (.xlsx)  
- Required columns:  
  - Age (time axis, numeric, e.g., kyr or Ma)  
  - Value (proxy measurements, e.g., δ¹⁸O values)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- Excel file path (full path including file name, e.g., `data/Oxygen_Isotopes.xlsx`)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- STAGE_LIMITS (default = 9 predefined intervals) – boundaries defining stages by age  
- OUT_XLSX (default = `Stage_Stats.xlsx`) – output table with statistics  
- OUT_PNG (default = `Stage_Stats.png`) – bar plot summarizing stage metrics  
- CONF_LEVEL (default = 0.95) – confidence interval level  
- FIGSIZE (default = (12, 6)) – figure size  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel file listing, for each stage: mean, standard deviation, IQR, confidence interval  
- Bar plot showing mean values with error bars for each stage  
- PNG figure saved to the output directory  
- Console messages confirming the saved output paths
