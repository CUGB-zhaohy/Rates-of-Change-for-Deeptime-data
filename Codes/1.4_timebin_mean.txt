### 1.4_timebin_mean.py

**Functionality**  
This script calculates the mean value within each time-bin of the input dataset.  
The mean is computed for proxy values (e.g., δ¹⁸O) falling within sliding time windows, providing a smoothed representation of long-term trends.  
The results are saved as Excel tables and plotted as mean-value time series.

**Input data**  
- Excel file (.xlsx)  
- Required columns:  
  - Age (time axis, numeric, e.g., kyr or Ma)  
  - Value (proxy measurements, e.g., δ¹⁸O values)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- Excel file path (full path including file name, e.g., `data/Oxygen_Isotopes.xlsx`)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- TIMEBIN_LIST (default = range(10, 19, 10)) – list of time-bin widths to process (in kyr)  
- START_AGE (default = 67000) – maximum age of the time axis  
- END_AGE (default = 0) – minimum age of the time axis  
- AGE_INTERVAL (default = 10) – step size for generating age nodes  
- TITLE_PREFIX (default = "O_Mean_") – prefix for figure titles and output files  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel files with columns: TimeBin, Age_node, Counts, Age_unique, Mean  
- Line plots of mean values versus Age_node  
- One Excel file and one PNG file for each specified time-bin width  
- Console messages confirming the saved output paths
