### 3.2_log_rate_interval.py

**Functionality**  
This script performs log-transformed regression between time interval length and rate-of-change values.  
It fits regression lines for different statistical measures (mean, quartiles, etc.) of the RoC results, calculates the R² goodness of fit, and generates plots showing the scaling relationship between rate and interval length.

**Input data**  
- Excel file (.xlsx)  
- Required columns:  
  - TimeBin (time interval length, numeric, e.g., kyr)  
  - Rate (rate of change value, numeric)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (file path is predefined inside the script but can be modified)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- INPUT_FILE (default = `C:\Users\...\RoC_summary.xlsx`) – input Excel file containing summary results  
- OUT_DIR (default = `C:\Users\...\RoC_LogFit`) – output directory for results  
- LOG_BASE (default = 10) – logarithm base for transformation  
- TITLE_PREFIX (default = "Log-Log Regression") – prefix for figure titles and output file names  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel file with regression statistics (slope, intercept, R²) for different measures  
- Scatter plots of log10(rate) versus log10(interval) with fitted regression lines  
- Figures saved as PNG in the output directory  
- Console output summarizing regression results
