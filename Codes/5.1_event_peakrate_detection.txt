### 5.1_event_peakrate_detection.py

**Functionality**  
This script detects the peak rate of change within predefined geological events.  
For each event defined by a start and end age, it searches the RoC curve and extracts the maximum value.  
It provides a systematic way to compare event intensities across multiple intervals.

**Input data**  
- Two Excel files (.xlsx):  
  1. Event definition file containing:  
     - Event name  
     - Start (start age)  
     - End (end age)  
  2. RoC results file containing:  
     - Age_node (time axis, numeric)  
     - Rate (rate-of-change values)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (file paths are predefined inside the script but can be modified)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- EVENT_FILE (default = `C:\Users\...\Events.xlsx`) – event definitions  
- ROC_FILE (default = `C:\Users\...\RoC_results.xlsx`) – rate-of-change dataset  
- OUT_XLSX (default = `Event_PeakRates.xlsx`) – output table  
- OUT_PNG (default = `Event_PeakRates.png`) – output figure  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel file listing, for each event: Name, Start, End, PeakRate, PeakAge  
- Plot with events highlighted, showing maximum RoC within each interval  
- PNG figure saved to the output directory  
- Console messages confirming the saved output paths
