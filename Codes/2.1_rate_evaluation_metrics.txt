### 2.1_rate_evaluation_metrics.py

**Functionality**  
This script evaluates the results of rate-of-change calculations using two quantitative metrics:  
- nTV (normalized total variation) – measures the cumulative variability normalized by time.  
- UVar (uniformity index of variance) – evaluates the distribution of variance using a rolling window and Gini coefficient.  
It provides a summary of these metrics for multiple input files, allowing comparison of different RoC methods and time-bin widths.

**Input data**  
- Folder containing Excel files (.xlsx)  
- Each file must include at least:  
  - Age (or Age_node / Age-point)  
  - Rate (e.g., IQR, slope, or bin-to-bin RoC)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (input folder and file pattern are predefined inside the script)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- INPUT_DIR (default = `C:\Users\...\Mean-Rate`) – directory containing result files  
- FILE_GLOB (default = `*.xlsx`) – file pattern to match input files  
- AGE_COL (default = "Age-point") – name of the age column  
- RATE_COL (default = "rate") – name of the rate column  
- AGE_WINDOW (default = 1000.0) – rolling window size for variance calculation  
- SAVE_CSV (default = True) – whether to save results to CSV  
- OUT_CSV (default = `nTV_UVar_summary.csv`) – path for output summary file  

**Expected outputs**  
- Console output showing nTV and UVar values for each file  
- A summary CSV file containing columns: File, nTV, UVar  
- Useful for comparing robustness and variability across different RoC approaches
