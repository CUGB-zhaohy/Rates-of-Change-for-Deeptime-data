### 1.6_timebin_mean_rate.py

**Functionality**  
This script calculates the rate of change between pairs of mean values separated by a fixed time-bin width.  
For each pair of bins, it computes the absolute difference in means divided by the bin interval, providing a bin-to-bin rate of change.  
Results are saved as Excel tables and visualized as time series plots.

**Input data**  
- Excel file (.xlsx)  
- Required columns:  
  - Age_node (time-bin midpoint, numeric)  
  - Mean (mean value within the time-bin)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (paths are predefined inside the script, but can be modified manually)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- time_bin_values (default = range(50, 1001, 50)) – list of time-bin widths to process (in kyr)  
- Input and output paths (default: `C:\Users\...\O_Mean_{tb}.xlsx`)  
- Plotting style: line color, marker type, axis limits  
- Title prefix (default = "Rate of Change —— δ18O [{time_bin_value}kyr]")  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel files with columns: Age-point, rate  
- Line plots of rate versus Age-point  
- One Excel file and one PNG figure for each specified time-bin width  
- Console messages confirming the saved output paths
