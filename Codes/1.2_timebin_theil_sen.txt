### 1.2_timebin_theil_sen.py

**Functionality**  
This script calculates the rate of change within each time-bin using the Theil–Sen median slope estimator.  
It outputs both the slope and its absolute value for each bin, providing a robust measure of change that is less sensitive to outliers than ordinary least squares regression.  
The results are exported to Excel and visualized as time series plots.

**Input data**  
- Excel file (.xlsx)  
- Required columns:  
  - Age (time axis, numeric, e.g., kyr or Ma)  
  - Value (proxy measurements, e.g., δ¹⁸O values)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- Excel file path (full path including file name, e.g., `data/Oxygen_Isotopes.xlsx`)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- TIMEBIN_LIST (default = range(500, 1001, 50)) – list of time-bin widths to process (in kyr)  
- START_AGE (default = 67000) – maximum age of the time axis  
- END_AGE (default = 0) – minimum age of the time axis  
- AGE_INTERVAL (default = 10) – step size for generating age nodes  
- TITLE_PREFIX (default = "O_Theil-Sen_") – prefix for figure titles and output files  

**Expected outputs**  
- Excel files with columns: TimeBin, Age_node, Counts, Age_unique, Slope_TS, Slope_abs  
- Line plots of absolute Theil–Sen slope versus Age_node  
- One Excel file and one PNG file for each specified time-bin width  
- Console messages confirming the saved output paths
