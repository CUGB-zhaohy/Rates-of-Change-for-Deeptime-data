### 3.1_merge_timebin_results.py

**Functionality**  
This script merges multiple time-bin result files into a single combined dataset.  
It extracts the `Age_node` column and one or more calculated metrics (e.g., slope, IQR, mean, rate) from each file, then aligns them into a single matrix for cross-scale comparison.  
This allows users to directly compare results from different time-bin widths.

**Input data**  
- Multiple Excel files (.xlsx) containing time-bin analysis results  
- Each file must include:  
  - Age_node (time-bin midpoint, numeric)  
  - One or more result columns (e.g., Mean, IQR, Slope_abs, rate)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (input folder and file pattern are predefined inside the script)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- INPUT_DIR (default = `C:\Users\...\IQR-ALL`) – directory containing result files  
- FILE_GLOB (default = `*IQR.xlsx`) – file pattern to select input files  
- AGE_COL (default = "Age_node") – column used for alignment across files  
- OUT_XLSX (default = `Merged_IQR.xlsx`) – output file path  
- DROP_NAN (default = False) – whether to drop rows with missing values  

**Expected outputs**  
- A single Excel file combining all input datasets  
- Rows aligned by Age_node and columns representing different time-bin results  
- Useful as input for further visualization (e.g., heatmaps, multi-scale curves)
