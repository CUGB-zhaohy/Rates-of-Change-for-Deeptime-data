### 3.3_multiscale_curves.py

**Functionality**  
This script compiles and visualizes rate-of-change curves generated at different time-bin widths.  
It overlays multiple RoC curves on a single plot to highlight how temporal resolution affects the shape, amplitude, and timing of variability.  
This provides a direct comparison of multi-scale results.

**Input data**  
- Multiple Excel files (.xlsx) containing time-bin results  
- Each file must include:  
  - Age_node (time-bin midpoint, numeric)  
  - Rate (rate-of-change values)  

**User inputs (interactive prompts)**  
- None (file paths are predefined inside the script)  

**Modifiable parameters inside the script**  
- INPUT_FILES (list of paths, default = several Excel outputs from earlier scripts)  
- AGE_COL (default = "Age_node") – column representing the time axis  
- RATE_COL (default = "rate") – column representing the rate of change  
- OUT_PNG (default = `RoC_Multiscale.png`) – name of the output figure  
- LINE_STYLES (colors, markers, etc.) – can be adjusted for clearer comparison  

**Expected outputs**  
- A single figure overlaying RoC curves from multiple time-bin widths  
- X-axis: Age (descending, older to younger)  
- Y-axis: Rate of change  
- PNG file saved to the output directory  
- Console message confirming the saved output
